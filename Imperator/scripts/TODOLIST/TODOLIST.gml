U_I_:
BRIEFS SHOULD HAVE 2 SPRITES PER TYPE- A NORMAL COLOR MATCHING SPRITE, AND THAT SPRITE WITH A PLUS IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER WHEN THERE ARE UPGRADES TO BE WON.
CREATE RANK UP CUTSVENE(?) VISUALS.
REFACTOR GAMECONTROLLER GUI FOR NEW LEVELTYPES AND SUCH
CUTSCENES
UNIFY ALL OF THE DISPLAY TEXTS FOR ALL THE PLACES WITH VENITE LARGE (MEDIUM NEW ONE) AND WHITE.
ADD A DRILL WRHIRRING NOISE WHEN UPGRADING SYSTEMS

M_E_C_H_A_N_I_C_S_:
PLANET SELECTION
ENEMY AI
FINAL BOSS
CONSIDER A SYSTEM WHERE SHIELDS REFRESH, BUT HP DOESN'T REPAIRS ARE REQURIED. POSSIBLY ENGINE BURNOUT, ENERGY CELLS ETC.



A_R_C_H_I_T_E_C_T_U_R_E_:
CONSIDER OPENING CAMERA OBJECT TO INCREASE FOV
CREATING ALL LEVELS
ENEMY TYPES









levels have points awarded, possible unlocks, and commendations. Required commendations for level up, once your surpass them, its a different bridge cutscene maybe. 
Points awarded tie to difficulty of the mission- maybe have a difficulty rating as well? stars, perhaps? Missions with unlocks typically provide very few to no point bonuses,
and have higher than average commendations so you have to choose.
I think i DEFINITELY want hp to stick with the ship, And you have to choose to repair it from the garage.
