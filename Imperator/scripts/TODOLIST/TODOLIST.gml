CREATE RANK UP CUTSVENE(?) VISUALS.
REFACTOR GAMECONTROLLER GUI FOR NEW LEVELTYPES AND SUCH

UNIFY ALL OF THE DISPLAY TEXTS FOR ALL THE PLACES WITH VENITE LARGE (MEDIUM NEW ONE) AND WHITE.
ADD A DRILL WRHIRRING NOISE WHEN UPGRADING SYSTEMS
CREATE HUD THAT IS ACTIVE DURING MISSIONS- ENCOMPASSES ALL THE EDGES OF THE SCREEN.
RIGHT CICK PLANET INFO
GARAGE CHANGES, DRAG AND DROP FIX AND UPGRADE RECEPTACLE. 
SHOW BRIEFS WITH DIFFERENT ICON WHEN UPGRADE IS AVAILABLE. 
ADD CUTSNENE ON LEVEL COMPLETION. SHIP FLYING AWAY?...
LEVELS SHOULD HAVE CORRECT PLANET IN THE BACKGROUND, AND THE SAME STARSCAPE


M_E_C_H_A_N_I_C_S_:
ENEMY AI
FINAL BOSS
CONSIDER A SYSTEM WHERE SHIELDS REFRESH, BUT HP DOESN'T REPAIRS ARE REQURIED. POSSIBLY ENGINE BURNOUT, ENERGY CELLS ETC.
FORCE BRIEF SELECTION ATER PLANET CHANGE, ENFORCED WITH GRAYED OUT HANGAR BUTTON AND IMPERATOR CHAT. THIS IS MOSTLY RELEVENT FOR RANK CHANGES
ENEMIES SHOULD SPAWN RANDOMLY?
"R" SHOULDN'T RESET THE GAME. ESC SHOULD TOGGLE MENU OPTIONS. BACK TO START, RESTART, SAVE, STATS, CONTROLS, ETC.
INSTEAD OF TRIGGERING LEVEL END ON CONTACT WITH INVISIBLE OBJECT, ITT SHOULD BE AFTER LEVEL CONDITIONS ARE MET. 
SHIFT TO ACTIVATE PULSE SHIELD

A_R_C_H_I_T_E_C_T_U_R_E_:
CONSIDER OPENING CAMERA OBJECT TO INCREASE FOV
CREATING ALL LEVEL TYPES
ENEMY TYPES
SHIP PASSIVES



STEALTH MISSION, COMPLETE WITH LIMITED # OF KILLS, PERHAPS EVEN DETECTION. 
COMPLWTING SOME MISSIONS WITHOUT POINT REWARDS?

CLOAKING? PASSIVE ON SHIP, REDUCES ENEMY DETECTION RANGE 9ALL SHIPS HAVE, DETECTION TAKES THIS INTO ACCT.
EVASION PASSIVE, EFFECTS % HIT. 
EXPERIENCED CREW PASSIVE, REDUCE RELOAD TIME
HOTSHOT CREW PASSIVE IMPROVES ACCURACY
FOV PASSIVE????




levels have points awarded, possible unlocks, and commendations. Required commendations for level up, once your surpass them, its a different bridge cutscene maybe. 
Points awarded tie to difficulty of the mission- maybe have a difficulty rating as well? stars, perhaps? Missions with unlocks typically provide very few to no point bonuses,
and have higher than average commendations so you have to choose.
I think i DEFINITELY want hp to stick with the ship, And you have to choose to repair it from the garage. 


LEVE TYPE IDEAS: 
Timed challenge, destroy objects within time frame. No enemies neccesarily, at least at the lower elvels. 
Points are awareded based on speed.

Specific targets- unlimited waves of weak ships, gotta kill the primary targets and escape.

Recon, scout and document areas without being discovered.

Escort missions. 



SHIP CAHNGES:
long term i believe this is what i want. Every ship has passives. These passives are pulled from a pool of possible passives,
and each ship type has a different pool.
Then, for each ship, it has between 4-0 of it's systems locked. this is random?
So you can have 3 of the same ship type, but they can be totally different.
Means you are not always upgrading the same ship, gotta pick what you have that works
also means purchasing upgrades depends on what ship you are running. makes shopping mroe dynamic
