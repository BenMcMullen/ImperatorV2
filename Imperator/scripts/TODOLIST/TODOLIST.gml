PLANET SELECTION
CUTSCENES
CONSIDER OPENING CAMERA OBJECT TO INCREASE FOV
CREATING ALL LEVELS
ENEMY TYPES
ENEMY AI
TYPES OF MISSIONS- CONTRACT, SURVIVAL, ESCAPE, OBJECTIVES? Create an object with step events that check for state
based completions of the given level- i could even run scripts per level, or make it dynamic to check the
current levels requirements for completion
FINAL BOSS

ADD A DRILL WRHIRRING NOISE WHEN UPGRADING SYSTEMS
CONSIDER A SYSTEM WHERE SHIELDS REFRESH, BUT HP DOESN'T REPAIRS ARE REQURIED. POSSIBLY ENGINE BURNOUT, ENERGY CELLS ETC.


levels have points awarded, possible unlocks, and commendations. Required commendations for level up, once your surpass them, its a different bridge cutscene maybe. 
Points awarded tie to difficulty of the mission- maybe have a difficulty rating as well? stars, perhaps? Missions with unlocks typically provide very few to no point bonuses,
and have higher than average commendations so you have to choose.
I think i DEFINITELY want hp to stick with the ship, And you have to choose to repair it from the garage. 





Deaths re-route you to the ??? Your mission is considered "completed"
but you obviously don't get points, and you don't get commendation. Probably EVENTUALLY want to putt in an edge case where if you have no remaining missions at your difficulty on 
ANY of your trees you lose. When you die, you lose your ships and your upgrades on that ship. Those upgrades are then removed completed from the list, and your ship is as well.
