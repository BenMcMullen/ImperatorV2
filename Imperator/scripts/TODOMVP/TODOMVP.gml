HERES THE DEAL. HERE IS A ROUGH TODO-LIST TO BRING MY GAME TO MVP


INTERTIAL DAMPENING SLOWDOWN. GPT has provided some solutions, definitely worth a look! ION NEEDS TO REMOVE EVERYTHING BUT THE DAMPENER SLOWDOWN.



HIVE ENEMIES? SHOOTING BIG SLOW BOYS, SLOW MOVING, BUT IF THEY GET DESTROYED THEY TURN INTO TINY SUICIDE ION DRONES OR SOMETHING. DRONE IS A GOOD NAME FOR AN ENEMY TYPE.

MORE CONSIDERATIONS. LOCK IN A PLANET PER RANK? PLANET BASED ENVIORNMENT VARIABLES
ONLY MARS HAS ASTEROIDS, VENUS HAS OLD SPACE HULKS, EARTH HAS LONG RANGE PARTICLE CANNONS MAYBE, THEY CAN BE DESTROYED?
GRAV WELLS TEATHER PLAYER TO LOCATION UNTIL DESTROYED OR OUTRUN
BREIFING RIGHT CLICK SHOULD BE EITHER ANOTHER ROOM, OR AT LEAST A HUGE MODAL. IT SHOULD BE FULL
OF ALL THE LEVEL INFORMATION, WHAT TO EXPECT ETC.


ADD MORE UPGRADES!
WE START WITH 4 SHIP CLASSES, AND 1 SHIP FOR EACH. THAT MEANS ONE NEW SHIP WITHA  NEW CLASS
3 UNIQUE PASSIVE SETS FOR EACH CLASS, ALL PRETTY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BUT UNIQUE FROM OTHER CLASSES. 
CREATING 5 NEW LEVEL TYPES
ENEMY TYPES ADD AT LEAST 3 MORE

FINAL BOSS

You are carrying a bomb which will replace secondary. Can be release when it range or some target.


At start of level set asteroids and ally/enemy frigates moving. its a time level so that solves waiting t hem out.
Spawn at different points on y axis. Add zoomout to camera to take in the scope of the mission.

Fix spawning of frigates so they don't interact. Add movement to giant asteroids
Asteroids needs random but still slow movement. They have hp, and are targeted by frigates. 

Queen Bees come from enemy frigates when you get within range of them- can rarely be avoided if at all. 

gotta get the actual launching of the nuke to work


STEALTH MISSION, COMPLETE WITH LIMITED # OF KILLS, PERHAPS EVEN DETECTION LIMITS.
