HERES THE DEAL. HERE IS A ROUGH TODO-LIST TO BRING MY GAME TO MVP


INTERTIAL DAMPENING SLOWDOWN. GPT has provided some solutions, definitely worth a look! ION NEEDS TO REMOVE EVERYTHING BUT THE DAMPENER SLOWDOWN.


ALSO ADD A WARNING IN YELLOW FOR INCOMING PARTICLE BEAM DURING THE DELAY BETWEEN LASER AND FIRING?

HIVE ENEMIES? SHOOTING BIG SLOW BOYS, SLOW MOVING, BUT IF THEY GET DESTROYED THEY TURN INTO TINY SUICIDE ION DRONES OR SOMETHING. DRONE IS A GOOD NAME FOR AN ENEMY TYPE.

MORE CONSIDERATIONS. LOCK IN A PLANET PER RANK? PLANET BASED ENVIORNMENT VARIABLES
ONLY MARS HAS ASTEROIDS, VENUS HAS OLD SPACE HULKS, EARTH HAS LONG RANGE PARTICLE CANNONS MAYBE, THEY CAN BE DESTROYED?
GRAV WELLS TEATHER PLAYER TO LOCATION UNTIL DESTROYED OR OUTRUN
BREIFING RIGHT CLICK SHOULD BE EITHER ANOTHER ROOM, OR AT LEAST A HUGE MODAL. IT SHOULD BE FULL
OF ALL THE LEVEL INFORMATION, WHAT TO EXPECT ETC.


ADD MORE UPGRADES!
WE START WITH 4 SHIP CLASSES, AND 1 SHIP FOR EACH. THAT MEANS ONE NEW SHIP WITHA  NEW CLASS
3 UNIQUE PASSIVE SETS FOR EACH CLASS, ALL PRETTY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BUT UNIQUE FROM OTHER CLASSES. 
CREATING 5 NEW LEVEL TYPES
ENEMY TYPES ADD AT LEAST 3 MORE

FINAL BOSS



Go towards a location, the whole time missiles and pulse shots and enemies are flying at you. Along the way there are large asteroids, they are moving at different speeds. There are also ship hulks, enemy frigates and ally frigates. they can all give you shelter temprarily, but the asteroids 
and dead hulks will take damage over time (once they are withing player sensors or maybe POV). 
You are carrying a bomb which will replace secondary. Can be release when it range or some target.



STEALTH MISSION, COMPLETE WITH LIMITED # OF KILLS, PERHAPS EVEN DETECTION LIMITS. 


CONSIDER ACTIVATEABLE BOMBS AND MISSILES. FIRST RIGHT CLICK FIRES, SECOND EXPLODES
